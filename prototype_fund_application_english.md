Communities and organizations today have no way of jointly making decisions in a decentralized manner. This means that whenever a disagreement occurs, some central authority or mediator is required to settle disputes. Mediators need to be impartial, objective, and trustworthy. However, this is often not the case: authority figures may embezzle funds, rule with bias, and promote personal agendas.

Looking at both public and private sector companies, institutes and communities, it is clear that legacy methods and approaches of governance are often insufficient or plain harmful.

Allowing better governance for both commercial and non-profit organizations and communities will dramatically decrease overheads, and simultaneously increase the trust of members in the system. Trustful and well-governed organizations invoke loyalty, dedication and productivity, which in turn benefit the organization further -- creating a virtuous circle.

**How will your project solve this problem? ***

**Max. 2000 characters**

We propose a decentralized system for transparent governance of communities and organizations. Our system would allow people to join a community, and receive from the system governance services. Such services will include resource allocation, taxation, voting on proposals, discreet communication, consensus building and structured moderation.

Later we intend to extend this system to allow AI-assisted governance, leveraging machine learning, game theory, cryptography and public policy knowhow in order to allow semi-automated complex decision-making. We also intend to increase privacy, ensuring that users’ votes and data are kept confidential. In order to allow more rapid development, during these alpha stages, the solution will still be run and stored on a central server.

As the user base grows, our solution will be transferred to employ blockchain technologies for decentralized computation (e.g. over Ethereum). This will allow a truly decentralized solution for this problem, which is fully tamper-proof, secure, history-remembering (i.e. persistent) and transparent.

When deploying such a system, each community will have its own separate instance of the system, with complete self-governance, its own currency, its own constitution, etc.

To further elaborate the system’s details: the system will correspond to what we currently think of as a country or co-op. Such a system can be roughly characterized by five factors: (i) resource management; (ii) communication; (iii) decision making; (iv) community governance; and (v) a constitution. In addition, since the system is electronic, we need to ensure methods for (vi) connection to the real world. 

As a complete system specification is beyond the scope of this document, we would like to elaborate just on some of the decision making facilities: The system will include a full-fledged voting system. Community members can put up measures for consideration. A measure must make it through a "show of interest", followed by a full vote (similar to the German referendum system).

The system will be implemented to allow full liquid democracy: a delegation-based voting method [1] where members can vote, or delegate their vote in easy-to-change ways, on a topic-based framework. The design will carefully avoid the many possible pitfalls.

**Who is the target audience? As it benefits from the project? ***

**Max. 2000 characters**

Initially we will focus on offering the project to small communities such as co-ops and house committees. In later stages, as the project matures, we will try to gain the interest of larger organizations like municipalities, and federations of smaller organizations (a co-op network for example). Finally, as the project matures alongside its user base, we hope it becomes the foundation for future countries and crowd-funded corporations.

 

In general, the system would allow any collaboration of persons sharing interests, funds, etc., to benefit from joint decision making and truly trusted decentralized governance.

To achieve success with the target audience, it will not be enough to create an excellent governance system: we will also need to lobby, to organize showcases, to create connections with decision-makers and to reach out to the community. Creating adoption of a parallel novel governance system is a long process. It will require extensive iterations with the user base in order to make the system more suitable to their needs: improving the political science behind the system, as well as its technical features. Gradually the system will become more attuned to the way that minimal-overhead decision making should operate.

 

Lastly, with blockchain technologies (Ethereum, etc) becoming more mature, it will be increasingly easier for communities and individuals to use our system. We believe that a system like the one we propose will be the inevitable way to employ governance in the medium-term future. Thus, we hope to create the gold-standard implementation for such a system -- non corrupt, non profit oriented, not based on undemocratic financial motivations -- today.

**Have you ever been working on the idea? If so, briefly describe the current state and explain the new feature. ***

We have been working on this system for the last four months. Currently, we are at the specification and proof-of-concept stage, where we are outlining the mechanisms of the system and writing a preliminary prototype in Python. 

Our plans for this prototype fund development stage is to finish the proof of concept, and take the system into a working alpha, capable of rallying a user base around it.

**Sketch briefly the most important milestones of your project. ***

**Max. 1500 characters**

First alpha: 

The system can run a completely secure crypto-governance system that supports resource management, communication and voting. This version will be decentralization-ready, but will not yet employ decentralized computation and storage. The system will not yet have mediation, consensus-building, privacy or AI-assisted governance.

Second alpha: 

adds mediation and consensus-building

Third alpha: 

adds privacy

Fourth alpha: 

adds basic AI-assisted governance. This stage will involve collaboration with public policy experts, governance experts and game theorists (e.g. auction experts).

Beta: 

The beta will be a truly decentralized application, running on Ethereum, Tezos or another Turing-complete blockchain. The beta will be developed when there is enough interest from the user-base: the entire operations will stay the same, since the alpha system was built in a decentralization-ready approach -- the only work required would be porting to a blockchain.
