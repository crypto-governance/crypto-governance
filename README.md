# Executive Summary for Crypto-Governance
# A new horizon for decentralized communities, transparent, crowd based decision making and resource management 

## Overview

Governance is a Technology. As such it leverages on its foundations: communication, finance, book-keeping, security - all enable, and necessitated by governance. However, as for centuries these technologies had remained largely unchanged, governance had also remained static/stagnant and unadaptive to the times. Much like during the Roman Empire, voting is still a representative system.

Indeed even before Roman times, governance had been a centralized technology. Power flowed to and was controlled by a central authority, be it a monarch, a senate or a stock exchange. History had proved time and again that centralized decision making leads to a wide variety of symptoms, ranging from inefficiency, to waste, corruption, and misrepresentation. 

Centralization of power may be extremely prevalent in our modern life, but is not predestined, nor has it ever been. Gutenberg’s printing press was a decentralization effort - from the church to the people. Initially, the Internet was also a decentralization effort. Now, like the Gutenberg press and the Internet, technologies for Blockchain and Distributed Synchronizing Ledgers will have massive unforeseen repercussions to all parts of life.

As people seek to better voice themselves, governance is ripe for disruption. And with the recent advent of decentralized systems such as Ethereum, IPFS, and others, a decentralized framework for governance is easily within reach, promising solutions to governance core problems. This revolution is not only inevitable, but at hand today.

## Vision

We propose a decentralized system for transparent governance of communities and organizations. Our system would allow people to join a community, and receive from the system governance services such as resource allocation, taxation, voting on proposals, discreet communication, consensus building and structured moderation.

Later we intend to advance this system to allow AI-assisted governance, leveraging machine learning, game theory, cryptography and public policy knowhow in order to allow semi-automated sophisticated decision-making. We also intend to increase privacy, ensuring that users’ votes and data are kept secret. 

Eventually, our solution will use blockchain technologies for decentralized computation (e.g. over Ethereum) in order to allow a truly decentralized solution for this problem, allowing it to be truly tamper-proof, secure, history-remembering (i.e. persistent), transparent etc.

### Detailed System Overview

The system will correspond to what we currently consider as a country or co-op. Such a system is characterized by five factors: (i) Resource management, (ii) communication, (iii) Decision making, (iv) community governance structure. (v) a constitution. In addition, since the system is electronic, we need to ensure a system for (vi) connection to the real world. Here are some more details on these factors:

Each community will have its own separate instance of the system, with complete self-governance, its own currency, its own constitution, etc.

#### Resource management

The system will have currency: a way to represent fungible resources. It will include a representation of real-world non-fungible resources. It will manage access and/or ownership of these non-fungible resources.

The fungible currency will be used for transferring value within the system, e.g. for paying fees (e.g. "cost of attention"), giving donations (for members whose contributions to the system are valued) and wages (for position-holders in the system, e.g. arbitrators). The system will also allow levying taxes or fees, according to what is allowed in the constitution. 

Unlike DAOs, where money is often levied in the beginning and is stockpiled in the system, we believe there is no reason for a decentralized system to hold funds more than what is needed for day to day expenditure. Thus, we intend the financials of the system to be managed with taxes and fees, which regularly flow in and out of the system, keeping the current balance low at any point, and making a take-over unappealing. [did I think about this all the way through?]

#### Communication

The system will allow secret point-to-point and broadcast communication. There will be a "price of attention" put on unsolicited communication, to avoid spam.

#### Decision Making

The system will include a full-fledged voting system. Community members can put up measures for consideration. A measure must make it through a "show of interest", followed by a full vote (similar to the German referendum system). Suggesting a measure will cost a modest “price of attention” fee. There will also be an identical system for constitutional amendments, which will require a larger quorum and a special majority, but is otherwise the same.

The system will be implemented to allow full liquid democracy: topic based system. Delegates. Fully liquid. Careful design will avoid pitfalls in implementation.

#### Constitution 

a constitution specifies all the parameters. Thus, different instances of the same system will be able to run both co-ops, full nation states, and DAOs, only requiring different settings for the constitution.

#### Community Governance 

voting is not all. The community will govern itself by moderators and arbitrators. Also, there will of course be the delegates of the liquid democracy. Most of these will perform as volunteers, that can accept contributions in the system’s currency. Some (e.g. the most senior super-arbitrators) may be wage-earners employed by the community.

This is like a court system.

#### Connection to the real world

Arbitration system, a-la bitsquare. Connection to the real world is always challenging, and we need more work on that.

This is close to the community governance, and is also like the court system

## Roadmap

### First alpha

The system can run a completely secure crypto-governance system that supports resource management, communication and voting. This version will be decentralization-ready, but will not yet employ decentralized computation and storage. The system will not yet have mediation, consensus-building, privacy or AI-assisted governance.

### Second alpha

adds mediation and consensus-building

### Third alpha

adds privacy

### Fourth alpha

adds basic AI-assisted (or at least automated/algorithmic) governance, using insights and consultation with public policy experts, governance experts and game theorists (auction experts)

### Beta

The beta will be truly decentralized app, running on Ethereum, Bigchaindb, Tezos or another Turing-complete blockchain. The beta will be made when there is enough interest from the user-base: the entire operations will stay the same, since the alpha system was built in a decentralization-ready approach: the only work required would be porting to a blockchain.

## Competition Overview

Generally speaking, there are three kinds of competitors:

1. Non-decentralized governance systems, e.g. liquid democracy and xxx

2. Decentralized governance services, e.g. the ones offered by Colony

3. DAOs

We will discuss each of these in order:

Type 1: there are multiple non-decentralized governance systems. Some of these are often rich and offer many insights on governance. They are not decentralized, and thus are technologically "old-world", with all the security and privacy issues that come with that, but we plan to use them as resources for learning on how to design our system well.

Type 2: There are several groups offering governance services. We don’t know of any one of them that offers a suite of services that is close or similar to what we propose. Some of these offer voting, others offer resource management, but none of them offers a complete crypto-governance scheme. We believe it is important to offer a complete integrated scheme, such that all parts of the system work in unison and have a common framework.

Type 3 — DAOs: DAOs (theDAO or other DAOs) are built under different philosophies and organizing principles than our system. They are closer to a "decentralized corporation", while what we offer is a “decentralized nation”.
